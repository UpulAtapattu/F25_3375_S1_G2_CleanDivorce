### Name: 
The Clean Divorce
### Description
Clean Divorce, which was founded by Suzanne Winlove-Smith, tries to address this gap in the market and the product portfolio, acts as a compassionate guide for the people who are going through or thinking of getting a divorce. The current products are available as informational website which facilitate divorce mediation and relationship coaching as a guided journey. It helps to understand the all the aspects of divorce process before moving forward. Furthermore, other resources such as guided journal, consultation is also available on the website. However, for today’s attention-deficit audience and their reliance on smartphone, these solutions could be enriched by an app accommodating all these products.
### Objectives
The idea is to create a wholesome product combining all the separate products into an integrated app, which provide bite size informational chunks. An Integrated Journey Map can be created which is a dynamic pathway that adapts based on different user circumstances. The core of the pathway will be a structured and progressive journey which is consist of series of manageable ‘bite-sized’ chunk. These steps would be visualised to create consistent engagement, tracking progress.
Furthermore, this app can be also augmented by guiding user to use useful tools for financial goals, personal goals, checklists before selecting lawyers, which could help the user to get some overall idea, which would make the divorce or mediation process easier.
The consultancy sessions booking can also be baked into the journey as suggestions as the user moves through different chapters, which is traditionally presented in a separate directory (like the webpage services section)."
